            <h2>Refund Policy: Confidence and Flexibility in Education</h2>
            <h3>Flexible Monthly Payments</h3>
            <p>
                Our payment structure is built to offer maximum flexibility, allowing students to pay monthly. 
                For the first six months, the fee is ₹3000 per month, followed by ₹2000 per month for the next six months. 
                This approach ensures that students continue with the program only if they find real value in the education and support we provide.
            </p>

            <h3>Refund Guarantee for Placement</h3>
            <p>
                We offer a placement guarantee for students who complete a minimum of 10 months in our boot camp. 
                If a student does not secure a placement offer either independently or through Codinggita's placement services by the end of their four-year program, 
                after completing at least 10 months with us, we will issue a full refund of the fees paid during those 10 months.
            </p>

            <h3>Empowering Students to Choose</h3>
            <p>
                Students have the choice to continue or discontinue their education with us at any point. 
                If a student chooses to leave the boot camp for any reason, whether due to dissatisfaction or after securing a job placement, 
                they are not obligated to pay any additional fees.
            </p>
