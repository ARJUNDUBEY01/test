        Students have the flexibility to leave the boot camp at any point, either if they are unhappy or after securing a job placement. If a student decides to discontinue the boot camp for any reason, no additional fees will be required.

        If you attend the boot camp for the first two months, you will pay a total of <strong>₹6,000</strong> (₹3,000 per month). If you participate for seven months, the total fee would be <strong>₹20,000</strong> for the first six months (₹3,000 per month) plus ₹2,000 for the seventh month.

        Codinggita is committed to ensuring the success of our students. As part of this commitment, we offer a placement guarantee for students who complete a minimum of 10 months in our boot camp. If a student, after diligently participating in our boot camp for at least 10 months, does not secure a placement offer either independently or through Codinggita's efforts by the end of their four-year program, we will provide a full refund of the fees paid during those 10 months. This policy underscores our confidence in the effectiveness of our program and our dedication to our students' career advancement.
