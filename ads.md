### **1. Define Dictionary? What are different ways of representing dictionaries? Explain.**

A **dictionary** is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. It is also known as a map or associative array.

#### **Ways of Representing Dictionaries:**
1. **Array-based Representation:**
   - Keys are mapped to indices in an array.
   - Example: Direct addressing (keys are unique and directly used as indices).

2. **Linked List Representation:**
   - Key-value pairs are stored in a linked list.
   - Example: Unsorted or sorted linked lists.

3. **Hash Table Representation:**
   - Uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.
   - Example: Hash tables with collision resolution techniques.

4. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Representation:**
   - Keys are stored in a BST, enabling efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
   - Example: Balanced BSTs like AVL or Red-Black trees.

5. **Trie Representation:**
   - Used for storing strings where each node represents a character.
   - Example: Standard tries or compressed tries.

---

### **2. Describe:**
#### **a) Hash Table:**
A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array. It provides O(1) average-time complexity for insert, delete, and lookup operations.

#### **b) Hash Function:**
A hash function takes a key as input and returns an integer (hash value) that corresponds to an index in the hash table. It should distribute keys uniformly to avoid collisions.
- Example: `h(k) = k mod m`, where `m` is the size of the hash table.

#### **c) Hash Key:**
A hash key is the input to the hash function. It can be any data type (e.g., integer, string) that is converted into an index in the hash table.

---

### **3. Define Collision? Explain Collision Resolution Techniques:**

#### **Collision:**
A collision occurs when two or more keys are mapped to the same index in a hash table.

#### **Collision Resolution Techniques:**
1. **Separate Chaining:**
   - Each bucket in the hash table is a linked list.
   - Colliding keys are stored in the same bucket as a linked list.
   - Example: Keys `12` and `22` map to index `2` in a hash table of size `10`. Both are stored in a linked list at index `2`.

2. **Open Addressing:**
   - All elements are stored in the hash table itself.
   - Techniques include:
     - **Linear Probing:** `h(k, i) = (h(k) + i) mod m`
     - **Quadratic Probing:** `h(k, i) = (h(k) + c1*i + c2*i^2) mod m`
     - **Double Hashing:** `h(k, i) = (h1(k) + i*h2(k)) mod m`
   - Example: If index `2` is occupied, linear probing checks index `3`, then `4`, and so on.

---

### **4. Describe Rehashing with Example:**

Rehashing is the process of increasing the size of the hash table and redistributing the keys to reduce collisions.
- Example: If the load factor exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.75), the hash table size is doubled, and all keys are rehashed using the new size.

---

### **5. Resultant Hash Table Using Linear Probing:**

Given keys: `12, 18, 13, 2, 3, 23, 5, 15` and hash function `h(k) = k mod 10`.

| Index | Key |
|-------|-----|
| 0     | -   |
| 1     | -   |
| 2     | 12  |
| 3     | 13  |
| 4     | 23  |
| 5     | 15  |
| 6     | -   |
| 7     | -   |
| 8     | 18  |
| 9     | -   |

---

### **6. Extendable Hashing:**

Extendable hashing is a dynamic hashing technique where the hash table grows incrementally. It uses a directory to point to buckets.
- Example: Keys are hashed to a binary value, and the directory uses the first few bits to map to buckets.

---

### **7. Quadratic Probing:**

Quadratic probing resolves collisions by using a quadratic function to find the next available slot.
- Formula: `h(k, i) = (h(k) + c1*i + c2*i^2) mod m`
- Example: If index `2` is occupied, check `(2 + 1*1 + 1*1) mod 10 = 4`.

---

### **8. Hashing and Hash Function Review:**

Hashing is a technique to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hash values). A hash function should:
- Be deterministic.
- Distribute keys uniformly.
- Minimize collisions.

---

### **9. Linear Probing and Quadratic Probing:**

- **Linear Probing:** Checks the next slot sequentially.
- **Quadratic Probing:** Checks slots using a quadratic function.

---

### **10. Collision Resolution Techniques:**

- **Separate Chaining:** Uses linked lists.
- **Open Addressing:** Uses probing (linear, quadratic, double hashing).

---

### **11. Double Hashing:**

Double hashing uses two hash functions to resolve collisions.
- Formula: `h(k, i) = (h1(k) + i*h2(k)) mod m`
- Example: `h1(k) = k mod 10`, `h2(k) = 7 - (k mod 7)`.

---

### **12. Skip List:**

A skip list is a probabilistic data structure that allows fast search, insert, and delete operations.
- **Search:** Traverse levels to find the key.
- **Update:** Insert or delete nodes while maintaining the skip list structure.

---

### **13. Binary Search Trees (BST):**

A BST is a tree where each node has at most two children, and the left subtree contains keys less than the root, while the right subtree contains keys greater than the root.
- Example: Insert `5, 3, 7` results in:
```
    5
   / \
  3   7
```

---

### **14. AVL Trees:**

AVL trees are self-balancing BSTs where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1.
- **Operations:** Insert, delete, and rotate (left, right, left-right, right-left).
- Example: Insert `3, 2, 1` results in:
```
    2
   / \
  1   3
```

---

### **15. B-Trees:**

B-trees are balanced tree structures used in databases and file systems. They allow multiple keys per node and have a high branching factor.
- **Operations:** Insert, delete, and search.

---

### **16. Red-Black Trees:**

Red-black trees are self-balancing BSTs with additional properties:
- Each node is either red or black.
- The root and leaves are black.
- Red nodes cannot have red children.
- Example: Insert `10, 20, 30` results in:
```
    20 (Black)
   /  \
 10 (Red) 30 (Red)
```

---

### **17. 2-3 Trees:**

2-3 trees are balanced trees where each node can have 2 or 3 children.
- Example: Insert `10, 20, 30` results in:
```
    20
   /  \
 10    30
```

---

### **18. Splay Trees:**

Splay trees are self-adjusting BSTs where recently accessed elements are moved to the root.
- Example: Accessing `10` in a tree results in `10` becoming the root.

---

### **19. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**

LCS is a dynamic programming problem to find the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
- Example: LCS of "ABC" and "AC" is "AC".

---

### **20. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:**

KMP is a pattern-matching algorithm that uses a prefix function to avoid unnecessary comparisons.
- Example: Search for "ABABC" in "ABABABC".

---

### **21. Brute Force Pattern Matching:**

Brute force checks each character of the pattern against the text.
- Example: Search for "ABC" in "ABABABC".

---

### **22. Boyer-Moore Algorithm:**

- Example: Search for "ABC" in "ABABABC".

---

### **23. Dynamic Programming for LCS:**

- Example: LCS of "ABC" and "AC" is "AC".

---

### **24. Huffman Coding:**

- Example: Suffix trie for "ABC":
```
    A
   / \
  B   C
```

---

### **26. Compressed Tries:**

Compressed tries merge nodes with a single child to save space.
- Example: Compress "ABC" and "ABD" into:

   / \
  C   D
```

### **27. Standard Tries:**

Standard tries store strings with each node representing a character.
- Example: Trie for "CAT" and "CAR":
```
    C
   / \
  A   A
 / \   \
T   R   T
```

---

### **28. Standard and Suffix Tries:**

Standard tries store strings, while suffix tries store all suffixes of a string.
